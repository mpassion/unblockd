## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for sensitive vulnerabilities.

Instead:

1. Open a private security advisory in GitHub (preferred), or
2. Contact maintainers privately.

Include:

- vulnerability description,
- impact assessment,
- reproduction steps,
- suggested mitigation (if available).

We will acknowledge receipt and work on a fix as quickly as possible.
